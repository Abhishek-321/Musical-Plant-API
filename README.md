# Musical Plant API
 This is the musical plant device and API for it

# Overview of our Idea
 It is a plant that people are more drawn to come back to. We do this by making a plant play music when it is gently tapped. The device will be able to convey the information of amout of water through sound. The shift in sound will convey this information.

 # Why is the project Useful?
 The project is useful as it solves the problem of people forgetting their plants and knowing how much to water too. 


 # Getting started
 To get started with the project, you need to download the folders and open index.html in a webbrowser. If further steps are required, it will be presented in each README.md. If you want to tweak the project, use a visual studio code to alter the code. 


All the works here are based on getting started examples from https://tonejs.github.io/.
